# Draft and Review versions of MOJ IT Policy content.

These documents are about MOJ policy regarding IT resources.
The documents have nothing to do with the functional aspects of MOJ work,
such as the judiciary, courts, Legal Aid, and so on.

Many aspects of MOJ IT Policy inherit from, or are guided by, higher or broader policy
statements, for example from the Cabinet Office.

## The `master` branch

This normally contains content that is published on the MOJ Intranet.
Content that is live (published) on the MOJ Intranet is definitive.

## Feature branches

Content in feature branches represents work-in-progress.
The branch name is either (preferably) a direct correspondence for an issue (eg issue0099),
or (alternatively) a simple name that indicates the objective of the feature work (eg updatepasswordpolicy).
