### About this guide<a id="about-this-guide"></a>

This guide gives you advice and guidance on the main security issues that are likely to affect you as a remote worker or a user of mobile computing facilities, (e.g. laptop computer, personal digital assistant, Blackberry etc), within the Ministry of Justice (MOJ), including its Agencies and Associated Offices. It also sets out your individual responsibilities for IT security when using
remote working and mobile computing facilities.

In certain circumstances the advice and guidance given may not apply to you because you are using a particular computer system or service. Any variations from this general guidance can be found in the user guide or user security documentation for the system. If in doubt contact your IT Security Officer In addition to this guide, mobile computing users must refer to the security operating procedures or user guide document they were provided with when they received their device for detailed instructions on secure usage.

### Who needs to read this guide?

This Remote Working and Mobile Computing Security Guide applies to all staff in the MOJ, its Agencies and Associated Offices, including contractors, agency and casual staff and service providers, who use computing equipment provided by the Department for remote working or mobile computing, or process any departmental information while working remotely or while using mobile
computing equipment.

Members of the judiciary who use computer facilities provided by the MOJ for remote or mobile working will also find this guide useful but should additionally refer to any separate security guidance provided specifically for the judiciary.

### What is remote working?

In this guide remote working means any working away from the office, whether from home, another MOJ or government office, whilst travelling, at conferences, in hotels etc, using computers and telecommunications technologies. Section 2 of this guide describes the risks of remote working and the measures to be taken against these risks.

Section 3 covers the issue of ad hoc remote working – the occasional use of computers, with or without remote access to a departmental network, to work at home or other remote locations by staff normally exclusively based at the office.

### What is mobile computing?

Mobile computing is the use of portable computing equipment. Remote working will usually involve the use of portable computing equipment, usually a laptop computer, but portable computing equipment is evolving rapidly and now includes personal electronic devices (PEDs), such as personal digital assistants (PDAs), Blackberries, functionally rich mobile 'phones and palmtop computers
which may include the functionality of mobile 'phones, digital cameras, voice recorders etc as well as email, web browsing and other computing functionality.

Section 4 of this guide specifically addresses the risks of using portable computing devices and the measures to be taken against these risks.

The portable computing equipment you use to conduct the Department's business must provide adequate security controls to appropriately manage the risks arising from their use. The commercial availability of any particular portable computing device, and its use by individuals or other organisations, does not indicate that it is suitable for carrying out MOJ business.

### Further copies and advice

This guide is available on the IT Security pages of the MOJ Intranet. For further advice on remote working and mobile computing please contact your IT Help Desk.

#### Key points to remember

- This guide covers the main security issues. Check your user guide or user security documentation for any specific security measures relating to your system.
- This guide applies to you if you use computing facilities for remote or mobile working.

## Remote Working<a id="remote-working"></a>

In this section
•	 Physical security requirements
•	 IT security requirements
•	 Key points to remember

### Physical security requirements

You may be working remotely from:

- Another departmental office;
- Home; or
- Any other location, such as while travelling, from a hotel or from other public locations.

If you are working from another departmental office you should find that physical security standards meet departmental physical security standards but you need to be aware of any possible shortfalls. For instance, you may be working outside of the secure area of the office, in an area that is accessible by the public. In this instance make sure that your office can be locked and that it is clearly marked as private. You will need access to lockable containers, such as cupboards and desk drawer, to enable you to lock away portable computing equipment and sensitive documents when not in use.

If you are working from home need to be aware that other users of the home may not understand the need for information security. It is your responsibility to check that having departmental equipment located at home does not invalidate your household insurance policy (buildings and contents).

You should:

- Take sole responsibility for protecting the computing equipment entrusted into your safekeeping;
- Prevent unauthorised access to official information from other members of the household and guard against accidental access by visitors by keeping it under lock and key, and out of sight; and
- Unless access to the working area can be strictly controlled then the equivalent of a clear desk policy must be exercised when you leave the room.

Accidental loss, theft, overlooking (shoulder surfing) and eavesdropping are the greatest risks when an individual uses computing equipment to work remotely, for example, when travelling and from hotels and other public locations.

When working outside of departmental offices or the home you will often be at locations that offer low levels of privacy and security so a high level of vigilance must be maintained.

- Take sole responsibility for protecting the computing equipment entrusted into your safekeeping;
- Portable computers must not be left unattended even for short periods;
- If you need to leave your computer take reasonable steps to ensure that it is kept secure e.g. lock it away out of sight in your car, use any available safe deposit / storage facilities at hotels or conferences, consider using a Kensington lock to secure your laptop if you need to leave it unattended in a hotel room or similar, etc; and
- Use a suitable bag to transport the equipment to avoid damage and to deter opportunist theft but avoid bags which advertise the fact that there is a computer inside.

### IT security requirements

When working remotely:

- Only use computing and telecommunications equipment provided by the
Department and only use this equipment for authorised purposes;
- If permanent network facilities are available at the local office you should consider using these in preference to any remote access method, for performance reasons, and especially if the permanent network access method offers better security than your remote access method (consult your IT Security officer for advice);
- Only use as a stand-alone computer or via an authorised remote access method to connect to the departmental system;
- Do not reconfigure, or attempt to reconfigure, your remote working computer to access any network other than the departmental system;
- Never keep a record of any password with the computer;
- Keep any security tokens (e.g. e-tokens) secure and separate from the computer unless actually being used to gain access to the computer;
- Disable the computer by using the screen lock/password-protected
screensaver facility when absent for even short periods;
- Log out when leaving the computer unattended for long periods;
- You must give the data stored on your computer appropriate protection corresponding to its sensitivity by using such measures as:
-- keeping the computer secure,
-- encrypting the hard drive, or
-- by using removable hard disks which can be stored securely when not in use;
- Computers which do not have hard disk drive encryption to the standard required by the Department must not be moved from any secure location, including to dwellings;
- Take care to avoid being overlooked when using the computer in a public place e.g. on public transport;
- Be especially cautious when working on protectively marked data. As a general rule, sensitive data should not be worked on in public;
- If you are able to you should regularly save your work on to the departmental network to ensure that it is appropriately backed up. If you cannot save work to a network drive you should back it up onto removable media e.g. disk, tape or memory stick, though note that these back-ups must be kept secure – see section 4.5 of the IT Security Awareness Guide for further details;
- If you are responsible for updating anti-virus software on your computer make sure that you do so frequently;
- Computing equipment provided by the Department is not provided for personal use but reasonable personal use is permitted. Reasonable use does not include connecting to any non-departmental device or to download or store large quantities of personal data. See also the IT Security Awareness Guide.
- Follow any instructions provided for changing your password(s). Where access to a departmental system is available remotely there are sometimes constraints on whether passwords must be changed remotely or when directly connected to the network and the correct procedures must be followed to prevent being locked out of the system;
- Where a computer is used to access a departmental system from a remote site, whether by permanent network connection or dial up / broadband or other remote access connection, you must adhere to the security policy for the departmental system; and
- Ensure you have access to and refer to any user guide or security operating procedures provided with your computing facilities.
You must return to the Department computers and computer software provided to you by the Department for home working upon request by your manager or when you leave the Department.

#### Key points to remember

- Be alert to the requirement to take addition measures to counter physical security shortfalls at the locations you are working from and provide adequate security for the computing equipment and information entrusted to you.
- Computing equipment provided by the Department must only be used for authorised purposes and must be returned to the Department on request by your manager or when you leave the Department.
- Follow instructions for updating anti-virus software, taking back-up copies of information and changing your password.
- Adhere to the security policy of any departmental computer system connected to.
- Follow the user guide or security operating procedures.

## Ad hoc Remote Working<a id="ad-hoc-remote-working"></a>

- What is ad hoc remote working?
- Using your own computer
- Using shared computing facilities
- Criminal Justice Secure Email
- Key points to remember

### What is ad hoc remote working?

In this guide ad hoc remote working is the occasional use of computing equipment to work away from the office. This will include working at home, and away at conferences, other offices, supplier sites, etc. The computing equipment will usually have the basic software tools such as MS Word, MS Excel, etc, and may or may not include remote connection to a departmental system. The computing equipment will usually be part of a pool of shared remote working computer equipment. The assumption is that the computing equipment will have been, and will be used for personal data and data up to RESTRICTED.

The requirements at section 2 apply for any remote working using departmental computing equipment issued exclusively to you.
There are particular measures you need to take if using shared remote working computing equipment.

As a general rule you should use computing and telecommunications equipment supplied by the Department for ad hoc remote working. However, it is recognised that there are circumstances when this is not possible so, for very occasional remote working e.g. on transport strike days or to complete a report, you may use your own computer provided you follow the guidance below, but you must
get approval from your manager first.

### Using shared computing facilities

If you use shared computing facilities for remote working (e.g. a laptop pool) you
should, **in addition** to the guidance in section 2:

- Delete information not required by anyone else from the computer before returning it to the pool (note that the delete function does not actually permanently delete the data but provides some “Need-To-Know” protection;
- Ensure you complete the log kept to record the removal and return of the equipment each time you borrow and return the equipment.

When a departmental computer is used for remote working you must remember that the IT Security Policy applies.

### Using your own computer

Contractors, consultants and agency staff may only use their own computers, or computers provided by their parent company, subject to the policy at Annex A.

You must not use your own computer to process any personal or sensitive data. This also means that you must not automatically re-route any email from your office based email account to your personal email account, nor can you forward any email that contains any personal or sensitive data to your personal email account. Neither can you use your own computer to remotely connect to any departmental system.

One of the most common reasons why you may sometimes work at home is to complete your Performance Management forms. The Department treats this information as RESTRICTED but as you are the producer and subject of this information you may use your own computer and send it over the Internet at your own risk. As a manager, however, you may not do this with your staff
Performance Management Forms or any other staff management information.

If you use your own computer for work it is your responsibility to:

- Check your insurance policy to see if it includes business use, as the insurance policy may be invalidated if personal property is used to carry out work for the Department;
- Supply the software and to ensure that the software used is compatible with that used by the Department;
- Address any computer support and maintenance issues;
- Ensure that the Department is not brought into disrepute by failing to meet any legal requirements; and
- Ensure that no connections are made, either wired or wireless, with any departmental system.

Staff should also ensure that they continue to adhere to the MOJ's records management policies when working remotely – see the What to Keep Guidance (intranet). In the rare instances that private email accounts (ie non-gsi accounts) are used for communicating substantive discussions or decisions about government business, staff must ensure that a gsi account (for example, a work email address) is copied into the email exchange. It is important that such content is readily accessible from within the Department in the event of, for example, a request for information under the Freedom of Information Act.

### Criminal Justice Secure Email

Some remote users may have a Criminal Justice Secure eMail Account (CJSM). The CJSM allow for secure transmission when sending emails over an un-trusted zone. The CJSM relies on the CSJM account holder meeting the CJSM terms and conditions to provide adequate security of data received via the CJSM.

CJSM email accounts may only be used for exchanging departmental data up to RESTRICTED provided that the CJSM account holder meets the CJSM Security Terms and Conditions (single user version) and the MOJ Security Policy namely:

- Comply with any data protection legislation and all professional codes of conduct/Departmental Security Policy by which you are bound in order to ensure that any data marked with a handling caveat (e.g. Official - Sensitive) is treated as the originator intended;
- Not share your user account details or password with anyone else (except as permitted by the CJSM Terms and Conditions);
- Communicate to CJIT (via the CJSM Helpdesk) all significant changes to your technical infrastructure that actually or potentially impact on access to, or the integrity of, the CJSM service so that an impact assessment can be carried out;
- Not transmit data through the CJSM that you know, suspect or have been advised is of a higher level of sensitivity than the CJSM is designed to carry (that is “Restricted” material) nor will material be forwarded to anybody other than on a need to know basis;
- Make regular back-ups of data to minimise any interruption in the event of a loss of IT capability;
- Have secure data storage facilities; and ensure that data archiving and retention policies are consistent with departmental data archiving and data retention policies.
- Use secure data deletion before the computer equipment is recycled or use secure disposal / destruction facilities commensurate with the requirement for the secure disposal of RESTRICTED data;
- Prevent physical access to the computer system;
- Protect against unauthorised access to computing devices used to send and receive CJSM email and any removable media used to store any protectively marked data by encrypting with a suitable product at least meeting FIPS1402 certification and by using password protection;
- Use a personal firewall or hardware firewall;
- Run an up to date anti-virus product and with regular and frequent updates; and
- Regularly apply operating system updates and security patches.

Note that you must not auto-forward from your departmental (GSi) email account to any CJSM email account.

See section 7 of the IT Security Awareness Guide for further information on sending emails to and from CJSM accounts.

#### Key points to remember
- As a general rule computers provided by the Department should be used for working.
- If you want to use your own computer to work at home get permission from your manager first.
- Do not use your own computer to work on sensitive or personal data. You can use your own computer to work on your own Performance Management forms, job application etc, at your own risk.
- Only use computing equipment provided by the Department for authorised purposes.
- If you use shared computing equipment be sure to delete data not required by anyone else before you return it to the computer pool.
- CJSM may only be used within the terms and conditions of CJSM and Departmental Security Policy.

## Mobile Computing<a id="mobile-computing"></a>

In this section

What is mobile computing?
Risks of mobile computing
Mobile computing precautions
Removable storage media

### What is mobile computing?

Mobile computing is the use of portable computing equipment. Mobile computing equipment is evolving rapidly. Examples of mobile computing equipment include:

- Laptop computers;
- Notebook computers;
- PEDs (Personal Electronic Devices) such as Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs)/Palmtops;
- Audio and visual recording/playback devices;
- GSM/GPRS/3G functionally rich mobile 'phones and other devices; and
- Removable storage media.

### Risks of mobile computing

Portable computers are expensive and easily carried and concealed. This makes them attractive to thieves.

They can be used anywhere, which increases the chances that data held on them will be seen by unauthorised persons and increases the risk of unauthorised modification or destruction of the data.

Some types of portable computers, including PDAs and pocket PCs, tend to be inherently insecure, making it difficult or impossible to secure against unauthorised access to the data held on them. It is sometimes, but not always, possible to install additional measures to provide adequate authentication, privacy and data integrity. For example, some PDA operating systems come
with password protection that locks down the PDA, but the password is stored insecurely on the PDA. That means whoever gets control of the PDA can hotsynch it with a PC where password-cracking tools can break in to access the data. In contrast, the password protection provided by some third party solution vendors includes encryption tools, and passwords not stored on the PDA.

It can be easier to misuse a portable computer e.g. by the loading of games, which increases the risk of malicious software infection.

Portable computers can utilise a variety of short and long range wired and wireless communications to interact with other computers and computer networks. These include via a connector on a cradle, short-range wireless/infrared links and mobile phone transmissions, including Internet connectivity.

Interception of data transmitted between the portable computer and other computers and computer networks via wireless transmissions as well as over any Internet connection therefore becomes an issue. Therefore, only authorised connection methods between portable computers and other departmental computers are permitted.

The ability to easily transfer data from an office computer to a portable computer increases the risk of transferring sensitive data that cannot be adequately protected on the portable computer. Connecting any insecure device to a departmental system storing personal may be grounds for legal action against the Department under data protection laws that require adequate security to be provided to personal data.

Removable media such as CDs, DVDs, floppy disks and mass storage USB memory sticks (sometimes called dongles) are a particular risk due to their small size yet ability to carry large (increasingly extremely large) amounts of data.

### Mobile computing precautions

You must acquire any mobile computing device used to hold, process or transmit data belonging to the Department through the Department's recognised procurement system.

Do not use any mobile computing device to hold, process or transmit any data at a classification above Official or to connect to any departmental computer system classified above Official without gaining prior approval from your IT Security Officer. It is likely that additional controls will be required that will require a minimum of three months to procure and install.

If the mobile computer does not have an approved access control mechanism, such as user authentication and encryption, and an approved deletion mechanism to remove data which makes it suitable for use for sensitive data, you may only store, process and transmit non-sensitive data.

You must give the mobile computer the same level of physical security as required by the information it holds.

You may only use mobile computing devices provided by the Department for authorised purposes.

Any changes to mobile computer hardware or software must be authorised under the Department's Change Management (RFC) arrangements. Prior notification of the proposed change to your IT Security Officer may avoid delays in gaining authorisation. You may not install any software, or reconfigure any operating system or security settings, unless prior written approval based on the submission of a Change Request (RFC) has been given.

Only the authorised service provider and/or administrative staff may carry out reconfiguration of any departmental mobile computer.

You must not take any mobile computing device capable of recording or transmitting sound or images including mobile 'phones, into any room where material above OFFICIAL is discussed or displayed, even when the device is switched off.

Do not remove any audit tags or asset labels stuck onto the mobile computer. If the audit tag or asset label becomes illegible or detached contact your IT help desk.

Sensitive data may only be stored, processed and transmitted by Blackberry devices that have been procured by the Department, are approved (accredited) to handle sensitive data and are synchronised with your departmental email account.

Blackberry users must read and refer to the user guide and security procedures provided with their Blackberry.

### Removable storage media

#### Guidance

All removable storage devices to be used on MOJ computer systems must be supplied by MOJ. Removable storage devices include, but are not limited to, writeable CDs/DVDs, memory sticks, cameras and disks. MOJ is responsible for ensuring that the devices are kept in safe custody and returned to safe storage, or securely disposed of, when no longer required. For this reason, and to avoid unnecessary expense, USB memory sticks and other removable media must only be requested where there is a genuine business need.

Generally speaking, using a removable storage device is probably the least secure method of storing and transferring data, so where better alternative methods are available these should be used, such as a secure laptop and secure internal and GSI email. By limiting the data being stored on the removable storage device to the minimum needed, the impact of any data loss is minimised. If sensitive information, such as names, can be removed from the information being stored, then this is also recommended.

If the data contains personal information it would be subject to the provisions of the Data Protection Act, including the requirement that such data should be given appropriate protection. The Information Commissioner has recommended that portable and mobile devices used to store and transit personal information, the loss of which could cause damage or distress to individuals, should be protected by encryption that meets a recognised standard.

Personal data is not the only information that may be regarded as sensitive. Other sensitive information will include any information that warrants a protective marking. Any sensitive data must be protected by encryption in the same way as sensitive personal data.

The increased media focus on data loss incidents within Government and other public service organisations and institutions means that even the loss of non sensitive data may attract adverse reporting and result in damage to MOJ's reputation. For this reason, only MOJ-provided encrypted removable media should be used. Where there is a valid business case, MOJ will be able to supply
encrypted USB memory sticks and these should be used in preference to any other removable storage device (except a secure laptop).

#### Using removable media

The following protective measures must be followed when using any removable storage device:

- Physically protect the removable storage device at all times – lock it away when not in use and transport it by carrying it about your person or using a trusted carrier service;
- Where possible retain the removable storage device within secure Government premises;
- Do not connect any removable storage device to your MOJ desktop or laptop from other sources, including from private companies, private individuals, other Government departments or other public sector organisations. Also do not use any removable storage device to transfer data between your MOJ desktop or laptop and any other computer. There is a risk of transfer of malicious software (e.g. computer viruses) to your computer and a risk of unintentional transfer of sensitive data to unsecured systems;
- Always check all removable storage devices for computer viruses before copying any file from it to your computer. You can do this by locating your anti-virus software on your computer and running the software to actively scan the 'drive' assigned to the removable storage device. See Anti-virus scanning of removable media for information, or contact your local IT support if you require assistance; and
- Always return the removable storage device to your IT service provider if it is faulty or you no longer need it, using Royal Mail signed for service. Delete the data on the device before returning it, if possible, but be aware that a normal deletion does not permanently erase the data so return the storage device using a secure method of transfer. In the event of loss of a removable storage device contact your local IT service desk.

If your IT is supported by Atos Origin please read Annex B for further information.

#### Anti-virus scanning of removable media

Insert removable media device

Click 'start' and select 'my computer'

Select the removable media drive (e.g. USB/CD/Floppy) and 'right click'

Click 'scan for viruses…' Anti-virus scan box appears

Click 'start scan' (green arrow).

The anti-virus scan will begin. If any virus is detected it will be displayed in the 'list of infected objects' box.

If no virus is detected you may proceed to open and/or copy file(s).

If a virus is detected; do not open or copy any file(s), remove the device immediately and report as a security incident. Do not insert the device into any other machine.

#### Procuring removable media

If you work in NOMS please contact your line manager.

All other staff must first read Operational Security Notice OSN 003 issued on 12/09/2008 OSN 003, then complete Annex C and email your business case to:<br/>
![](https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/intranet-prod-storage-1dvcquh7kophi/uploads/2017/12/c44e91c8a5d308c4953ef918b987f543.gif)&nbsp;

#### Key points to remember
- Using mobile computing equipment significantly raises the risk to departmental data.
- Only authorised mobile computing facilities may be used.
- Additional controls are needed for the use of mobile computing devices and equipment to safeguard the data held on them.

## Annex A - From the Chief Information Officer<a id="policy-statement-on-data-security"></a>

**Policy statement on data security and use of IT equipment by contractors/consultants and Agency staff employed by the Ministry of Justice**

Contractors, consultants and agency staff providing services to the Ministry of Justice may use their own computing facilities to deliver those services with the following conditions:

1. These computing facilities must be their 'tools of trade', i.e separate from personal computing facilities used by themselves or their families, etc, for leisure or other personal uses; and must employ best practice security controls such as up to date anti-virus control, personal firewall, access control, disk encryption and up to date software patches.

2. Use of these computing facilities should be limited to activities involving MOJ data such as producing reports, reviewing documents, sending and receiving emails, and should not involve storing and processing large volumes of MOJ data, for example database extracts.

3. The disk encryption employed must conform to the FIPS140-2 standard or CAPS (CESG Assisted Product Scheme).

4. Where the computer connects to a remote network e.g. the contractor's company network, then an encrypted link must be used.

5. No emails containing sensitive or personal data should be sent un-encrypted over the Internet. Personal and sensitive emails may be exchanged via the Criminal Justice Secure Mail System (CJSM). The CJSM is accredited to handle OFFICIAL – Criminal data, so consideration should be given to the suitability of CJSM where the data relates to other types of official information, e.g. Policy Guidance on determining what is personal data is available from the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) web site at www.ico.gov.uk.

6. Any removable media used to transport data outside of secure buildings must be encrypted with a product certified to FIPS 140-2. Once no longer required these devices should be securely disposed of. CD/DVDs and floppy disks should be cut into four pieces and disposed of as normal waste.

7. Computer hard disk drives should be securely erased before disposal or recycling if it has held any personal or sensitive data. Information Assurance Branch should be consulted on the procedure to be followed.

8. In compliance with the Data Protection Act, any personal data must be deleted when no longer required, thus must not be retained beyond the duration of engagement with the MOJ.

9. Where there is a need to provide access to large volumes of personal or sensitive data only MOJ computing facilities must be used. Removable media provided by MOJ must be returned to the MOJ after use.

10. Paper records containing personal data should be stored, transported and disposed of securely. Sensitive waste paper should be collected separately from normal waste, and stored securely pending destruction by shredding or burning. As with electronic records, particular care should be taken when moving bulk paper records.

# Annex B - Removable Media<a id="removable-media"></a>

Safe, Sound and Shared, eDelivery Group, November 2008

### Removable Media

#### Guidance for staff supported by the Atos Helpdesk

**INTRODUCTION**

The recent high proﬁle losses of government-held data have resulted in new measures being mandated to protect information being held by government. These include controls on the use of mobile devices. Although no organisation can guarantee it will never lose
data, data losses due to a failure to comply with these mandatory measures are likely to have signiﬁcant consequences for the individuals and organisations involved.

For example, Government has committed to introduce new sanctions under the Data Protection Act for the most serious breaches of its principles (Data handling procedures in Government: Final Report, June 2008). All staff and contractors who use MOJ corporate systems must therefore comply with the following requirements.

**GUIDANCE**

All removable storage devices to be used on MOJ computer systems must be supplied by MOJ. Removable storage devices include, but are not limited to, writeable CDs/DVDs, memory sticks, cameras and disks.

MOJ is responsible for ensuring that the devices are kept in safe custody and returned to safe storage, or securely disposed of, when no longer required. For this reason, and to avoid unnecessary expense, USB memory sticks and other removable media must only be requested where there is a genuine business need.

Generally speaking, using a removable storage device is probably the least secure method of storing and transferring data, so where better alternative methods are available these should be used, such as a secure laptop and secure internal and GSI email.

By limiting the data being stored on the removable storage device to the minimum needed, the impact of any data loss is minimised.
If sensitive information, such as names, can be removed from the information being stored, then this is also recommended.

If the data contains personal information it would be subject to the provisions of the Data Protection Act, including the requirement that such data should be given appropriate protection. The Information Commissioner has recommended that portable and mobile devices used to store and transit personal information, the loss of which could cause damage or distress to individuals, should be protected by encryption that meets a recognised standard.

Personal data is not the only information that may be regarded as sensitive. Any sensitive data must be protected by encryption in the same way as sensitive personal data.

The increased media focus on data loss incidents within Government and other public service organisations and institutions means that even the loss of non-sensitive data may attract adverse reporting and result in damage to MOJ's reputation. For this reason, only MOJ-provided encrypted removable media should be used.

Where there is a valid business case, MOJ will be able to supply encrypted USB memory sticks and these should be used in preference to any other removable storage device (except a secure laptop).

At this time MOJ is unable to provide any other method of encryption that would meet any recognised standard.

**USING REMOVABLE MEDIA**

The following protective measures must be followed when using any removable storage device:

- Physically protect the removable storage device at all times – lock it away when not in use and transport it by carrying it about your person or using a trusted carrier service.

- Where possible retain the removable storage device within secure Government premises.

- Do not connect any removable storage device to your MOJ desktop or laptop from other sources, including from private companies,
private individuals, other Government departments or other public sector organisations. Also do not use any removable storage device to transfer data between your MOJ desktop or laptop and any other computer. There is a risk of transfer of malicious software (e.g. computer viruses) to your computer and a risk of unintentional transfer of sensitive data to unsecured systems.

- If in exceptional circumstances you must connect a removable storage device from another source to your MOJ desktop or laptop, you must ﬁrst assure yourself of the trust-worthiness of the source. Do not under any circumstances use any removable storage
device provided as a promotional gift or from an unknown source.

- Always check all removable storage devices for computer viruses before copying any ﬁle from it to your computer. You can do this by locating your anti-virus software on your computer and running the software to actively scan the 'drive' assigned to the removable storage device. See Anti-virus scanning of removable media for information, or contact your local IT support if you require assistance.

- Always return the removable storage device to Piccadilly Exchange, First Floor, 2 Piccadilly Plaza, Manchester M1 4AH if it is faulty or you no longer need it, using Royal Mail signed for service. Delete the data on the device before returning it, if possible, but be aware that a normal deletion does not permanently erase the data so return the storage device using a secure method of transfer.

- In the event of loss of a removable storage device contact the service desk:<br/> ![](https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/intranet-prod-storage-1dvcquh7kophi/uploads/2017/12/64a07aab5f77479e27c487c3f8e20296.gif)&nbsp;

**ANTI-VIRUS SCANNING OF REMOVABLE MEDIA**

- Insert removable media device

- Click 'start' and select 'my computer'

- Select the removable media drive (e.g. USB/CD/Floppy) and 'right click'

- Click 'scan for viruses…' Anti-virus scan box appears

- Click 'start scan' (green arrow).

The anti-virus scan will begin. If any virus is detected it will be displayed in the 'list of infected objects' box.

If no virus is detected you may proceed to open and/or copy ﬁle(s).

If a virus is detected; do not open or copy any ﬁle(s), remove the device immediately and report as a security incident. Do not insert the device into any other machine.
