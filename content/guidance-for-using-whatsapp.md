- reasons why you [might](#why-whatsapp), or [might not](#whynot-whatsapp), want to use WhatsApp

## Overview

WhatsApp Messenger is a free, cross-platform messaging platform, owned and operated by Facebook.

WhatsApp supports audio ('voice') calls, video calls, text messages including emoticons, and the ability to attach and share images, documents, or other files.

WhatsApp also allows you to share your location with other users.

Messages can be sent between two devices, or between larger groups.

WhatsApp normally runs from mobile devices. As part of the sign-up process, you supply your mobile device telephone number. This is used to verify you. When WhatsApp is installed on a mobile device, you can link a desktop WhatsApp application to your account.

WhatsApp needs access to your mobile device contact list. It might also need access to the device's microphone, camera and file stores to enable video calls. 

If you comply with MOJ Acceptable Use and Information Management requirements, then you can use WhatsApp for work purposes.

## Security

WhatsApp uses end-to-end encryption to ensure that only intended senders and receivers can view message content. The WhatsApp software manages the encryption keys. The sensitive 'private keys' are never sent to WhatsApp servers.

The WhatsApp application makes reasonable efforts to protect messages and message content. Nevertheless, it is important that the device is considered as a whole - how it is updated, how it is encrypted, how it is backed up.

### Why WhatsApp can be a useful tool

WhatsApp can be a highly useful real-time messaging tool letting you:

- send and receive 'rich' messages in real-time
- use WiFi or mobile data networks to communicate - avoiding the use of airtime minutes (particularly when roaming)
- communicate with others when you have WiFi or mobile data but not mobile (GSM) signal
- exchange images, files and other documents quickly
- conveying urgency through an immediate notification instead of via email

<a id="whynot-whatsapp"></a>

### Why WhatsApp is not always the best tool

WhatsApp is not always the best tool as:

- MOJ already uses Slack, which provides similar encryption benefits (ensuring unintended third-parties cannot access message content/data)
- sharing files/documents via WhatsApp requires copying them to/from the mobile device first
- WhatsApp is designed for real-time use, so it is hard to find information later
- manual copying/export of WhatsApp content is required for meeting MOJ/legislative information management requirements, such as the Public Records Act (1958) or Freedom of Information Act (2000).

But as long you consider the pros and cons of using WhatsApp and plan any mitigations (such as ensuring you copy data from WhatsApp into a formal MOJ tool soon thereafter) using WhatsApp for work can be OK.

### Using WhatsApp in MOJ

- Register to WhatsApp using your MOJ-issued mobile device and telephone number
- Enable 'Show Security Notifications' (Settings > Security)
- Enable 'Two-step Verification' (Settings > Two-Step Verification)
- Consider whether you need to give WhatsApp access to your mobile device's camera, microphone and data stores (usually 'camera roll')
- Remember that your WhatsApp data is only as secure as any mobile device backups you also make, or desktop computers you use with desktop WhatsApp applications

<a id="dataprotection"></a>

### Privacy and personal information (Data Protection) with WhatsApp

WhatsApp requires a copy of your contacts list which is uploaded to WhatsApp servers in order to enable WhatsApp to function correctly. You must consider whether this is reasonable to do, and does not impact any one else's privacy in a negative way.

Data protection legislation makes you responsible for personal information you work with. You must keep it safe and secure. In particular, you must follow data protection obligations. These include the Data Protection Act 2018 and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

You should not use WhatsApp to exchange or store personal data within messages themselves for work purposes.

Complying with personal information requirements can be complex. Don't hesitate to ask for advice:<br/>

### Information Management with WhatsApp

WhatsApp can only be used for your day-to-day communication with colleagues (if using it for work) and so this information is [classified](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-security-classifications) at `OFFICIAL`.

MOJ provides email, document and other communication tools such as Slack, Microsoft Office 365 and Google G-Suite which are generally much better suited to exchange work information.

Think about the MOJ information you work with when using WhatsApp -  What would happen if you lost your mobile device, or it's stolen? Suppose the voice/video calls was overheard in a cafe, or read from your screen on a crowded train. Could there be damaging consequences? If the answer is 'No', then it's probably OK to use WhatsApp to communicate that information with colleagues.

You have a duty of confidentiality and a responsibility to safeguard any HMG information or data that you access. This is [Principle 2](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-security-classifications) of the Government Security Classifications. The MOJ trusts you to work with `OFFICIAL` information. You're trusted to make a reasoned judgement about whether it's safe to use WhatsApp or whether you should use a different MOJ provided work tool.

Remember that it is impossible to delete information after it's released in public.

### Storage and data retention

Laws and regulations make the MOJ and its employees responsible for managing information. Some examples include:

- the Freedom of Information Act
- the Data Protection Act and General Data Protection Regulation
- the Public Records Acts

When we receive a request for information, we need to know where we hold all the relevant information. Storing business information on appropriate MOJ systems helps us, because:

- we can provide evidence about decisions
- we understand the information held, and where to find it
- we can transfer records to The National Archives

Always store MOJ information in MOJ systems. If you use WhatsApp to discuss work topics, make sure the key information is also stored in an appropriate MOJ system. Guidance on what you must keep is available [here](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/knowledge-information/managing-information/what-to-keep/). At regular and convenient intervals, transfer the information to an appropriate MOJ system. Do the same when you finish the work. Don't forget to remove any redundant information from WhatsApp by clearing/deleting conversations.

WhatsApp lets you export your data. You can then store it on an appropriate MOJ system. Sometimes it's easier to copy and paste text into a new document. Make sure that only the correct people have access to the information. This is important after staff or organisational changes, for example.

For more guidance, read the [MOJ Information Management Policy](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/documents/2015/04/information-management-policy.pdf). There is also help on [responding to requests for information](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/knowledge-information/providing-information-to-the-public/freedom-of-information/).

### Service and support

WhatsApp is a free platform and thus has very limited support. WhatsApp requires the underlying network operated by WhatsApp/Facebook to be available, which is also not guaranteed so that doesn't mean WhatsApp will always be available and always work as you expect.

The MOJ can't provide technical support or ensure service availability for WhatsApp. Always have another way of communicating if WhatsApp is not available for some reason or for any length of time. In other words, don't let WhatsApp become business critical.

<b>Note: The MOJ cannot provide technical support for WhatsApp.</b>
