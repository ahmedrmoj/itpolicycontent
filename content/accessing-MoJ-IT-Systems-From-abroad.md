In general, it is acceptable for MOJ users to access MOJ services from abroad, and to do this using their MOJ equipment.

But before you travel, consider:

- Do you need to take MOJ IT equipment abroad or access MOJ IT systems to do your job?
- Can the business need be met in another way or by someone else?
- If you just need to manage your inbox while away, can you delegate permissions to your inbox to a colleague to manage on your behalf?

As a government official travelling overseas, you should consider that you may be of interest to hostile parties regardless of your role. By following MOJ policies and processes, you can help reduce the risk to yourself and limit the damage of exposure of sensitive information.

**Special case:** If you are national security cleared to 'Enhanced SC' or DV levels, you must also contact [Corporate Security](mailto:corporatesecuritybranch@justice.gsi.gov.uk) branch before travelling, regardless of whether the trip is for business or personal reasons.
 
If you need to access MOJ services from abroad and visiting one of the following countries, you must seek permission from your line manager and SCS/Governor first. If they approve, submit your request to Operational Security ![](https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/intranet-prod-storage-1dvcquh7kophi/uploads/2017/12/c44e91c8a5d308c4953ef918b987f543.gif), giving at least 14 days' notice. This is because it may be necessary to apply additional technical controls to protect you, your device, and any data they can access.

- China, Cyprus, Egypt, France, Germany, India, Iran, Israel, North Korea, Pakistan, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea, Syria, Turkey, UAE

If you want to take an MOJ 'Blackberry' device to countries other than in Europe or North America, contact Operational Security ![](https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/intranet-prod-storage-1dvcquh7kophi/uploads/2017/12/c44e91c8a5d308c4953ef918b987f543.gif)&nbsp; for additional guidance.

## Making a request

First, collect the following information:

- Name
- Email address
- Your Security Clearance
- The network you use
- The make/type of equipment you want to take with you
- Asset Tag details
- Country of travel
- Dates of travel
- Proposed method of connecting, for example MOJ VPN
- Reason for maintaining access while abroad

Second, get confirmation from your line manager that there is a business need for you to take the MOJ equipment abroad and access MOJ services.

Next, obtain formal business approval by sending your request [form](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/documents/2015/04/taking-it-equipment-abroad-request-form.doc) to the appropriate person, using the following table:

| Who | Action |
| --- | --- |
| MOJ HQ or HMCTS MOJ staff | Send your request to your Senior Civil Servant (SCS) |
| HMPPS HQ staff | Send your request to your Information Asset Owner (IAO) |
| All HMPPS staff *except* HQ | Send your request to your governor |

When you have received business approval, send a copy of your request and the approval to Operational Security ![](https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/intranet-prod-storage-1dvcquh7kophi/uploads/2017/12/c44e91c8a5d308c4953ef918b987f543.gif)&nbsp;

When Operational Security have acknowledged receipt of the request and approval, the process is complete.

## International Roaming

While travelling, you might incur roaming charges when using your MOJ equipment for calls or accessing services. These charges can be expensive, and must be paid by your Business Unit. This is another reason for having a good business need to take MOJ equipment abroad.

By default, MOJ equipment is not enabled for use abroad. Before travelling, contact the [MOJ Phone and Mobile Devices](mailto:MoJ_Phone_and_Mobi@Justice.gov.uk) team. Ask them to enable International Roaming, and to activate the remote wipe function. This helps protect the MOJ equipment in case of loss or theft.

## If you have any problem when using MOJ equipment abroad

Contact the Service Desk immediately. Tell them if the MOJ equipment is lost, stolen or was potentially compromised. This includes any time the equipment is deliberately removed out of your sight, such as by a customs official.

When calling from abroad, the contact telephone numbers you need are:

1. Technology Service Desk (DOM1): +44 (0)1270 612 618
2. NICT Service Desk: +44 (0)191 587 8388
 
If any security-related incident occurs overseas, regardless of whether it involves MOJ equipment, you should contact [Corporate Security Branch](mailto:corporatesecuritybranch@justice.gsi.gov.uk) as soon as possible.

For any emergency outside normal UK business hours, contact the Duty Security Officer on +44 (0)20 3334 5577, or email: [dutysecurityofficer@justice.gsi.gov.uk](mailto:dutysecurityofficer@justice.gsi.gov.uk)
 
If there is a problem with your MOJ equipment, it might be necessary to disable your ability to connect to the MOJ network or services from your device. The Service Desk will do this if required. MOJ-issued phones might still have some functionality, to let you make phone calls, but the device should be treated as compromised and not used any more for any MOJ business.
