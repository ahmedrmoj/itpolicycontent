## ITHC Overview

The purpose of an ITHC is to provide evidence and assurance to support risk management decisions. It is often the minimum deliverable required to support a decision by the Accreditor for a system seeking to go-live.
  
As outlined in GDS Service Manual - Information security - Making sure user data stays secure, ITHC forms part of the assurance process. 

It is designed to ensure that security functionality has been implemented correctly, and to identify vulnerabilities in IT systems and networks which may compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information held on systems and networks. In some circumstances an internal vulnerability scan will provide sufficient assurance. 

## The ITHC 

The need for an ITHC will often be identified by the Accreditor, IA consultant, or IA Analyst when building or designing new IT systems. For new projects and programmes, this will generally be determined based on a number of factors, including: 

- the project’s delivery plan, 
- scope of delivery, 
- maturity of the product, 
- available architecture assurance on the product  
- the phase of delivery (e.g. Alpha, Beta, ...)
 
For systems that are live and have transitioned into Business as Usual (BAU) operation, there will be an ongoing need to check that the IT controls in place still meet the current threat and vulnerability for the operational environment. This may involve a periodic ITHC over the lifetime of that system, an initial periodicity should be determined during the Acceptance into Service (AIS) process. 

The scope of the ITHC must be agreed by the assurance lead before ITHC commencement to ensure that the relevant controls are included in the test to provide the IAO or System Owner assurance that vulnerabilities will become known and managed. 

The delivery and procurement of the ITHC is the responsibility of the project or system owner but must be supported by the relevant suppliers. It is important to ensure that the business is made aware of, and agree to accept the risk of, any potential disruption that might be caused by an ITHC of their live system. 

A CHECK2/CREST3 approved team must undertake the ITHC. The CHECK and CREST schemes demonstrate that the ITHC is undertaken to industry standards, and provides evidence of the integrity and professionalism of the testers and of the quality of the delivered reports.

Internal Security Engineering Team is authorised to conduct ITHCs on MOJ systems using experienced security testers. 

An ITHC report must be completed as soon as practically possible after the completion of the test. The report must describe any identified vulnerabilities using language that the business owner can understand, avoiding technical jargon as far as possible. The report must include a realistic indication of impact and likelihood of each vulnerability.  

Any risk or vulnerabilities identified as Medium High or higher during an ITHC should be brought to the attention of the assurance lead immediately rather than waiting for the report to be produced. 

The ITHC report must be delivered to the Accreditor, the project (if applicable) and the service provider at the same time. 

There must be ring-fenced funding for ITHCs and any necessary remediation of vulnerabilities throughout the life of the system. The ongoing periodicity should be reviewed after each ITHC.    

## Internal Testing 

For systems that are developed by MOJ in-house staff, the assurance lead may agree to ITHCs being undertaken by appropriately trained MOJ staff, and hence potentially not undertaken under either the CHECK nor CREST schemes. In agreeing to this approach, the assurance lead obtains the assurance that the ITHC will be undertaken to their satisfaction from knowing the MOJ staff and from the lack of commercial conflict that might arise if a non-MOJ supplier was being contracted to deliver the system.

## Report Construction 

Once the ITHC has been completed a report identifying the findings must be completed as soon as possible and submitted to the MOJ within a maximum of 5 working days unless agreed with the Accreditor. 
 
As a minimum the output of the health check report must include the following: 

- the report is readable and accessible to the non-technical customer and contain a clear summary of the number, type and severity of the issues identified
- where possible CVSSv3 base scores must be included and a risk statement rating the likelihood and impact of each vulnerability identified using the following terminology, LOW, MEDIUM/LOW, MEDIUM, MEDIUM HIGH, HIGH
- the report must present in full the background, scope and context of the health check
- the report must provide details of the individuals who completed the ITHC  

Each identified vulnerability should be brought to the attention of the supplier or system owner and discussed so that a remedial solution inclusive of a relevant time frame for completion can be identified. The remedial solution should not be seen as the sole method for reducing the risk - a short-term remedial action may be appropriate until such time that a strategic fix can be put in place. 
 
## Risk Management 

Each vulnerability must be assigned a risk rating. 

Any risk identified as LOW must be mitigated or managed by the Accreditor on the behalf of the IAO. 

Any risk higher than LOW must be owned and managed by the IAO/System Owner. 

## Remediation Plan 

A copy of this plan must be given by the Accreditor to the relevant IAO and/or System Owner. The Accreditor will ensure that the IAO and/or System Owner is aware that they own the remediation plan, relevant actions and associated risks. It is the responsibility of the IAO/System Owner to review this plan and ensure actions are reviewed and completed.  

A copy of the remediation plan must be held by the Accreditor in a central location and risks should be reviewed periodically with the IAO/System Owner and, as a minimum, during any re-accreditation process.
