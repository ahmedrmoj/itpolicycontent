Information and the supporting processes, systems and networks are important and valuable departmental assets. They are central to enabling the department perform its functions and provide services to the public, the legal professions, and other government departments and organisations.

Confidentiality, integrity and availability of information is essential to maintain the department's ability to provide efficient and effective services, maintain compliance with legal and regulatory requirements and maintain its and the Government's reputation.

The department and its information systems and networks are faced with security threats from a wide range of sources, including computer-assisted fraud, sabotage, vandalism, fire and flood. Sources of damage such as computer viruses, computer hacking and denial of service attacks have become more common, more ambitious and increasingly sophisticated.

The department's increasing dependence on its information systems and services means that it is more vulnerable to security threats. The interconnecting of the department's computer networks with public and other private networks, and sharing of information resources increases the difficulty of achieving control.

It is essential that the department identify its information security requirements. There are three main sources of these requirements.

*   the first source is the legal, statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements that the department, its partners, contractors and service providers have to satisfy.
*   the second source is the particular set of principles, objectives and requirements for information processing that the department and Government have developed to support their operations, for example the protective marking system and government baseline security standards.
*   the third source is derived from assessing risks to the department. Through risk assessment the threats to assets are identified, the potential business impacts of these threats are estimated and the vulnerability to and likelihood of occurrence of the threats are evaluated.

## Assessing information security risk

Security requirements are identified by a methodical assessment of security risks. Expenditure on security controls needs to be balanced against the business harm likely to result from security failures. Risk assessment is systematic consideration of:

* the business harm (ie the impact) likely to result from a security failure, taking into account the potential consequences of a loss of confidentiality, integrity or availability of the information and other assets; and
* the realistic likelihood of such a failure occurring in the light of the threats to and vulnerabilities of the system, and the controls currently implemented.

## Managing information security risks

The results of the risk assessment are identified risks and risk severity's that help guide and determine the appropriate management action and priorities for managing information security risks. Risks with a high severity level would justify the expenditure of more resources to control them than risks with a low severity level. Risk Management involves identification, selection and implementation of justified security and contingency 'countermeasures' to reduce risks to an acceptable level.

Countermeasures can act in different ways such as:

* reducing the likelihood of attacks or incidents occurring
* reducing the system's vulnerability
* reducing the impact of an attack or incident should it occur
* detecting the occurrence of attacks or incidents
* facilitating recovery from an attack or incident

Risk management therefore requires a judgement on what is an acceptable level of risk. Although this is a business decision it does require a thorough understanding of the nature of the risk and the effectiveness of the countermeasures implemented to manage the risk. For some information systems specialist advice may be needed.

When taking risk management decisions consideration must be given to the full implications of the decisions taken. The failure to implement some countermeasures may breach legal or regulatory requirements, which is unlikely to be an acceptable risk management decision. Failure to meet other countermeasures may breach HMG information security standards and as a consequence it may not be possible to link the system with other systems, such as the GSi, thereby limiting the usefulness of the system.

Consideration must also be given to what are tolerable financial loss, political sensitivities and adverse publicity. The cumulative effect of accepting high levels of risk should also be taken into account.

## Information security in projects

Information security controls are considerably cheaper and more effective if incorporated at the system requirements specification and design stage. Information risk assessments must be part of the project process.

## Ongoing information security risk management

Effective risk management does not end once a risk assessment has been done and the required countermeasures implemented. Checks need to be carried out to ensure that the countermeasures are being applied effectively. It is also important to carry out periodic reviews of security risks and implemented controls to:

* take account of changes to business requirements and priorities;
* consider new threats and vulnerabilities; and
* confirm that controls remain effective and appropriate.

## The role of IT security branch in risk assessment and risk management

IT security branch can provide help in all areas of security risk management of IT systems e.g.

* advise on risk assessments
* carry out risk assessments
* assist in the risk management decision process
* provide security documentation compliant to BS7799 / HMG standards (mandatory for GSi connectivity)
* carry out mandatory HMG risk assessments (IS1 and IS3)
* advise on compliance checking
