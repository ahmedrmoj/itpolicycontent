## Web browsing security policy profiles

<b>This policy applies to all staff and contractors who work for the MOJ, _and_ who have been migrated to Microsoft Office 365.</b>

There are two policy profiles, one for the [Judiciary](#judiciary), and one for [all other staff](#allotherstaff).

Each profile identifies categories of content that are normally blocked. Content that is not in a blocked category will normally be available to a profile.
