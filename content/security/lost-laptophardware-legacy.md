What info is recorded? Details of loss:

*   Time, place, circumstances, reported to, actions taken to resolve;

*   If other hardware containing information, e.g. drive, was it encrypted?

Where is it recorded? - Incident Response and Tuning Team log on .....

Do we tell others? - Operational Security Team, IT Admin Team.

**It is important that macbooks are shut down, and not just locked, when you are not using them and leave the security of Government buildings;**

**A lost/stolen laptop can be accessed more easily if you have only locked it, as opposed to fully shutting down and enforcing the disk encryption.**
