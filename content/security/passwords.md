Passwords are essential for protecting MOJ IT systems. Passwords help control access to the information stored and managed on the systems. Passwords help assure identity, and so permit authorised access.

You should protect your passwords to the best of your ability.

[Password Guidance][pg] gives you information about using passwords, and your responsibilities for them. For information about choosing and using passwords, see the [Password Standard][ps]. For the detailed rules about passwords within the MOJ, see the [Password Policy][pp].
