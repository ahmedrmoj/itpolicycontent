<b>This guidance applies to all staff and contractors who work for the MOJ.</b>

## What to do if your device is lost, stolen, or compromised

> Note: You can help reduce problems by making sure that devices used for MOJ tasks are always shut down before leaving Government premises. Locking a laptop, or 'putting it to sleep' is not completely secure. A lost or stolen laptop can be accessed more easily if it is only locked or sleeping. A shut down makes sure that all security measures are in place, such as full disk encryption.

> Note: For HMCTS and HMPPS, please follow the procedures on your local intranet.

If you think your device is lost, stolen, 'hacked', or in some way compromised, you must:

1.  Contact the Technology Service Desk. The analyst will ask the relevant questions and note responses on the ticket. The contact telephone number you need is:<br/>![](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/app/uploads/2017/12/74015bc20bb1c38fb4249c4ef6d3cfed.gif)<br/>&nbsp;<br/>or if calling from overseas:<br/>![](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/app/uploads/2018/05/8fc27c901ed47aa9d7edcb8ff4121e66.gif)<br/>&nbsp;<br/>
2.  Tell your line manager as soon as possible.
3.  For a lost or stolen device, contact the Police and make sure you get the incident reference number.
4.  When back online fill in a [security incident form](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/security/report-a-security-incident/).
5.  Email the completed form to:<br/>
a. Security Breach if the incident involves a data breach<br/>![](https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/intranet-prod-storage-1dvcquh7kophi/uploads/2018/11/b0c1f3bf14ff265c2369a84cf1bf05c2.gif)<br/>&nbsp;<br/>
b. IT Service Desk for all other IT incidents<br/>![](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/app/uploads/2017/12/e6404c31d65821489a775401ce4b941d.gif)<br/>&nbsp;<br/>
