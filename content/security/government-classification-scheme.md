title: Government Classification Scheme

## Source  

These summary guidelines are based on “The Government Security Classification (GSC)” as issued by the Cabinet Office in 2018. The link below provides full handling guidance for Authority data covering OFFICIAL, SECRET and TOP SECRET:

[https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-security-classifications](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-security-classifications)

In summary, the majority of information that is created or processed by the public sector is now classified as OFFICIAL. The other two classifications are SECRET and TOP SECRET.

SECRET classification should be used on very sensitive information that justifies heightened protective measures to defend against determined and highly capable threat actors.

TOP SECRET is the HMG's most sensitive information requiring the highest levels of protection from the most serious threats.
