## Source code publishing

<b>This guidance applies to all staff and contractors who work for the MOJ. In particular, it applies to product owners, technical architects, security architects, and developers.</b>

MOJ policy about making source code developed by the MOJ available complies with [UK Government guidance](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard).

By default, MOJ developers must develop source code in a way that means it can be stored and published in the open. There are exceptions, for example sensitive material such as encryption keys.

This document is not about the use of existing open source materials.

## Reasons for working in the open and sharing source code by default

[Point 8](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard#criterion-8) of the Digital by Default Service Standard states that:
 
> Make all new source code open and reusable, and publish it under appropriate licences (or provide a convincing explanation as to why this cannot be done for specific subsets of the source code).

This includes "[Making source code open and reusable](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/making-source-code-open-and-reusable)".

## When you should not publish materials in the open

There are some circumstances when materials should not be public.

Obvious examples include security or encryption keys or credentials, and configuration details. Other examples include:

- algorithms used to detect fraud
- materials that relate to unreleased policy
- API keys for cloud-hosted applications or environments, for example AWS

An important exception is for materials developed by third parties. They might have retained ownership of the Intellectual Property (IP).

More guidance to help you decide when to publish materials in the open or not is available [here](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-source-guidance/when-code-should-be-open-or-closed).
