## Storing data on laptops

The guidance applies to all MOJ staff, excluding NOMS.

If you need to store data on your laptop hard drive (usually your D: Drive) you should always remember to move it into TRIM or your local equivalent Electronic Document and Record Management (EDRM) system, a shared drive (for example, G: Drive) or your home drive (H: Drive) as soon as you next connect to the network.

## Where should I save data when using a laptop?

It is best to avoid saving any data on a laptop hard drive. However, if you absolutely must, you should always remember to copy or move the data to the network as soon as you next connect to it, either via remote access or by direct connection.

In order to avoid potential data loss, save data in:

*   **TRIM** or your local equivalent EDRM system where possible
    or

*   **shared drives** (e.g. G: Drive, W: Drive, L: Drive)
*   **home drives** (H: Drive)

There is a better chance of recovering lost data if you have saved it to the network, in TRIM, a 'group' shared drive or a 'home' drive, as we backup data stored on the network daily.

## What is the impact of hard drive failures?

Hard drive failures can lead to the irrecoverable loss of data. Any data loss can have security implications for MOJ and a significant impact on:

*   our business opportunities
*   our reputation, and
*   our ability to deliver services to the public

If you experience any issues with your laptop or IT service you should contact the IT Service Desk.

## How to reset your Security BeCrypt (eToken) password

To reset your password you will need to contact the IT Service Desk. They will check whether they have your memorable word. Where they do, you will be asked to confirm certain characters of the word and your password will be reset and you will quickly regain access to your laptop.

If you have not previously registered for the Self Service Password service and therefore do not have a memorable word or you are unable to remember it, your identity will need to be confirmed by another method and this may add a delay in your incident being resolved. You will be requested to ask your line manager or court manager to confirm your identity by sending an email to the IT Service Desk. On receipt of the email the IT Service Desk will reset your password.

## Have you registered for the Self Service Password Service?

If you haven't already enrolled, it is urgent that you do so now.

Copy and paste the following link into your browser:

https://accountselfservice.dom1.infra.int/pmf/SelfService/ and set up your personalised security questions, the answers and your memorable word. Or go to Favourites in your browser and go to 'Account Self Service'.
