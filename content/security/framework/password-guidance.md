<b>This guidance applies to everyone who works for the MOJ, or who supply systems or services to the MOJ.</b>

## Overview

This document is the MOJ IT Security - Password Guidance. It helps you protect MOJ IT systems by telling you about using passwords. It explains your responsibilities for passwords.

All government departments must follow HMG security standards. An important part of compliance is ensuring that all users:

- have a unique ID
- can authenticate using their ID
- are auditable

Passwords help ensure that compliance.

## Always\.\.\.

- follow the [GOV.UK advice](https://www.cyberaware.gov.uk/passwords) to generate your passwords
- use a password that is
  - at least 8 characters long
  - no more than 128 characters long
  - strong enough for the information or system you are using. The system should force you to choose a strong password
- change your password if it provides access to any information or system affected by a security incident
- try to use a password that has one or more of each of the following character types:
  -  upper case
  -  lower case
  -  digits
  -  special characters such as '`@`', '`$`', '`%`', or '`^`'

<!--
- use a password manager, to help you choose and store your passwords
-->

## Never\.\.\.

- have your username within the password
- use an [obvious password](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_most_common_passwords), such as '`passw0rd`' or '`12345678`'
- use a dictionary word on its own. A combination of dictionary words might be suitable, such as '`CorrectHorseBatteryStaple`'
- use a password for more than one account or service
- re-use a password
- write a password down
- share a password with anyone, unless you are accessing a shared account, service, or system
- store the password on the same device or in the same service that is accessed by using the password
- let someone else see any part of your credentials when you access a system

## Access sharing

Unauthorised sharing or use of a password or other access control is a security breach. Doing this can result in disciplinary action against you.

### Do not\.\.\.

- access or try to access another person's email account
- use or try to use an identity other than your own
- attempt to access information outside of your normal access rights or duties

## Passwords for a new account

You get a one-time or single-use password with a new account. The first time you login to the account, you must change the password.

Some systems might not ask you to change your password after first use. Make sure you change your password immediately anyway. If you experience any problems, contact the [IT Service Desk](#contacts).

## Forgetting or resetting your password

All MOJ systems and services should help if you forget your password. There is usually a `forgotten password` link in the login page. Use this link to request a password reset email. When you receive the email, follow the instructions to create a new password for the account.

Some systems might not provide a forgotten password option. Sometimes, it is not obvious how to reset your password. In these cases, contact the [IT Service Desk](#contacts).
