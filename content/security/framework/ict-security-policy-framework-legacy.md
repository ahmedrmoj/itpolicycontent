MoJ's ICT security policy forms part of MoJ's corporate security policy. 

*   [Corporate security policy](/documents/2015/04/security-policies.doc)

IT systems are crucial in delivering the Department's core business activities effectively and all staff are required to understand their obligations in how to safeguard MoJ data and how to use IT appropriately.

 The ICT security policy framework is designed to:

*   inform you on the acceptable use of MoJ ICT
*   let you know how to safeguard information assets from unauthorised access and modification
*   describes how you should use, access and disclose information in accordance with protective marking policies, regulations and applicable legislation
*   allows the department to detect, manage and recover from security incidents with the least disruption to the organisation
*   ensure MoJ IT suppliers and service providers comply with the minimum requirements set out in this policy and within the wider security policy framework
*   ensure that MoJ information and IT assets are utilised for MoJ business use only
*   enable MoJ to make best use of its investment in IT
