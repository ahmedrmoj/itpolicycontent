This  document  is  the  MOJ  ICT  Security – Information Classification and Handling Policy. It provides the core set of ICT security principles and expectations on  the handling and classification of information on MOJ ICT systems.

## Introduction

The MOJ stores and processes a wide variety of information some of which attracts an HMG protective marking and/or contains personal information. The MOJ has a duty to protect all the information stored and processed on its ICT systems.

This policy outlines the Information Classification and Handling Policy for all information held on MOJ ICT systems.

## Scope

This policy covers all staff (including contractors and agency staff) who use MOJ ICT systems.

The overarching policy on information classification and handling is maintained by the [MOJ Corporate Security and Business Continuity Branch](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/security/). This document only contains IT specific policies which are in addition to the overarching policy.

The overarching policy can be found at the following location:

<https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/security/it-computer-security/government-classification-scheme/>

All Users **must be** made aware of the Information Classification and Handling Policy and provided with security awareness training which covers this policy.

All Users **must be** provided with refresher security awareness training which covers this policy every 12 months.

## Inventory of assets

All information assets need be identified and have a nominated asset owner, to help ensure that the appropriate protection of these assets is maintained.

Examples of what an information asset constitutes are:

- Databases and data files;
- System documentation;
- User manuals, training material, operational or support procedures;
- Security documentation (e.g. RMADS or Disaster recovery plan);
- Archived backup data.

The list of information assets and associated Information Assets Owners is coordinated and maintained by individual MOJ business groups where the responsibility resides with the business group SIRO.

All MOJ business groups **must maintain** a list of information assets, their associated named Information Asset Owner (IAO) and which ICT system/s it resides on. Note, some information assets may not be held on ICT systems.

## Deriving a classification

At the MOJ, all information assets are assessed against HMG guidance on business impact (contained within [HMG IA Standard No.1 & 2][hmgia12] ) and HMG guidance on the protection of personal data (see HMG Information Assurance Standard No.6, [here][hmgia6] ). This assessment can be used to select the appropriate classification from the HMG protective marking scheme however a classification is primarily derived from the Government Protective Marking Scheme (GPMS).

All information assets stored or processed on MOJ IT systems **must be** assessed against [HMG IA Standard No.1 & 2 – Business Impact Levels][hmgia12] and [HMG IA Standard No.6][hmgia6] where an impact level for the Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability (for each asset) is derived.

All Users are responsible for applying a protective marking (where
appropriate) to information asset created or handled on an IT system where a
pre-existing marking does not exist.

**Note** – As outlined in [MOJ IT Security Policy][sp], each ICT system is required to have a Business Impact Assessment (BIA). This BIA should be used to record the assessment rational and decision on the impact levels for Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability.

Further information on the criteria and derivation of an HMG protective marking can be found at:

## Application of HMG protective markings

The HMG protective marking system defines how information should be labelled and handled. Output from ICT systems containing information that is protectively marked needs to carry that marking. This includes, but not limited to, printed reports, removable media (backup tapes, CDs, memory sticks, etc), electronic messages (such as e-mail) and file transfers.

All IT hardware and removable media assets **must be** labelled with the highest HMG protective marking of each of the individual information assets stored or processed on it. Note – this marking may be reduced if sufficient security controls are applied (e.g. whole disk encryption) upon agreement with the system Accreditor or ITSO.

All output from an ICT system **must include** the highest HMG protective marking of each of the individual information assets contained within that output.

Where applying a HMG protective marking label is not feasible, an alternative method **must be** agreed with the system Accreditor or ITSO.

Further information on the application of a protective marking can be found at:

## Information handling on MOJ ICT systems

The MOJ policy for handling protective marked material applied to all MOJ IT assets and all outputs from an IT system.
