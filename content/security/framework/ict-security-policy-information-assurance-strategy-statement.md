## Vision, Strategy and Direction

The MoJ ICT Information Assurance Strategy Statement sets out for all staff how the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) protects information processed, stored or transmitted on its ICT systems. The areas of the MoJ covered by this strategy are; all MoJ business groups, ALBs, contractors, ICT suppliers and partners who have access to, or, process MoJ information.

The MoJ Board is committed to protecting information effectively and endorses the need to be compliant with the standards and requirements set out by Cabinet Office and legislation. Our dependence on ICT systems and networks means that their confidentiality, integrity, availability and connection to other government systems are crucial to our daily operations and ability to perform our mission. The business of the MoJ includes the delivery of public services and we are committed to protecting the personal sensitive information pertaining to members of the public and our own staff on our ICT systems.

The MoJ recognises the value new technologies and working practices can offer, however, the ICT systems which support them must also maintain a high level of confidentiality, integrity, and availability/resilience. It is essential that Information Assurance (IA) is embedded into the design, implementation and operation of all ICT solutions and that the value of adopting new working practices such as remote working is balanced with the need to manage risks and comply with our IA obligations. To ensure risks to MoJ ICT systems are managed consistently, the MoJ corporate risk appetite level for risks to ICT systems is set at **cautious** where the intention is for this level to be validated before being applied to a particular ICT system.

A governance structure is in place to protect the information assets against the risk of loss, misuse, unauthorised disclosure, inaccessibility and damage to national interests and to our reputation. Information assurance governance within the MoJ is the ultimate responsibility of the MoJ Board. This responsibility is delegated across the MoJ through Senior Information Risk Owners who sit on the MoJ SIRO Board.

The MoJ SIRO Board advocates a vigilant approach to risk management so we can strike the right balance between business opportunities and the threats we face as an organisation. By managing the risks, we will make it more difficult for those who wish to compromise our systems to do so. However we must never lose sight of the fact that our ICT systems and the information they hold remain a high value target.

Lack of awareness by staff and disregard for security policies, procedures and legislation undermines our defence against the various threats faced by the MoJ and puts our organisation at risk of being non-complaint with HMG standards and the law. All staff need to embrace a culture of IA and ensure we manage our information assets appropriately from creation to disposal.

## Governance and Accountability

The MoJ Board recognises its role to provide leadership on Information Assurance (IA) and supports the creation of an IA-aware culture throughout the organisation. MoJ's Permanent Secretary delegates responsibility for IA to MoJ's Senior Information Risk Owner (SIRO) who is a member of the MoJ Board. The MoJ SIRO serves as an advocate for information risk management on the MoJ Board and provides written advice on information risk to the Accounting Officer as an input to MoJ's annual Governance Statement.

Each MoJ business group and executive agency in turn appoints a SIRO which provides a clear focal point for IA and will have responsibilities aligned with those of the MoJ SIRO but for their defined business area.

The MoJ operates a SIRO Board attended by the MoJ SIRO and business group and executive agency SIROs. The SIRO Board provides a cross-MoJ focus on IA from a business perspective. The SIRO Board ensures the MoJ achieves the required standards of information assurance and compliance through:

- Agreeing departmental information management and information security strategies and policies;
- Assessing risks to the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information assets, as recorded on the MoJ risk register, at least quarterly;
- Prioritising and supporting information risk management activities as appropriate;
- Championing information assurance best practice across the Department, raising staff awareness and establishing a culture of good information handling to support business objectives;
- Ensuring information governance structures are appropriate, adequate, and linked to other areas of departmental activity.

The MoJ IT Security Officer (ITSO) advises on IT security policy, technical IT risks, technical security controls and produces guidance on HMG SPF and ISO 27001 compliance.

This governance structure supports our need to meet HMG security requirements as expressed in the HMG Security Policy Framework (SPF) and a commitment to improved Information Assurance across the organisation.

## Approach to ICT Risk Management

The HMG Security Policy Framework (SPF) mandates that:

> All ICT systems that handle, store and process protectively marked information or business critical data, or that are interconnected to cross-government networks or services (e.g. the Government Secure Intranet, GSI), must undergo a formal risk assessment to identify and understand relevant technical risks; and must undergo a proportionate accreditation process to ensure that the risks to the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the data, system and/or service are properly managed. – extracted from MR 8.

As such, all ICT systems that process protectively marked information must undergo a formal risk assessment (using HMG IA Standard No.1 & 2 and 6) and proportionately accredited before they can be used. This is not a static assessment and is subject to a schedule of review and update.

Information security is the preservation of confidentiality, integrity and availability of information and providing accountability on the use of that information.

- Confidentiality: Ensuring information is only accessible by those authorised to have access;
- Integrity: Safeguarding the accuracy and completeness of information and processing methods;
- Availability: Ensuring that authorised users have access to information and associated assets when required;
- Accountability: Maintain control of information and proving an audit trail covering its creation, use and disposal.

The Ministry of Justice regards the protection of its information as vital in order to meet its Public Service Agreements and key objectives, in maintaining public and supplier confidence that the information held will be kept secure, to ensure the continuity of government services and systems and to ensure that the MoJ contributes to the effectiveness of arrangements for maintaining the security of shared systems such as the Government Secure Intranet.

The Ministry of Justice recognises the importance of complying with statutory requirements for information security in order to protect its reputation with the public, the judiciary, other public sector organisations and voluntary and private sector organisations. The Ministry of Justice has particularly high standards to meet with respect to the Human Rights Act 1998, the Data Protection Act 1998, the Freedom of Information Act 2000 and the Public Records Act for which the MoJ is the lead department.

## MoJ ICT Security Policy Framework

Our approach to Information Assurance is based on the ownership of information risks by an Information Asset Owner (IAO) or Senior Information Risk Owner (SIRO). This is set within the context of all ICT systems (and their users) applying and following 'fit-forpurpose' ICT security practices and procedures. Ensuring consistency of ICT Security is important to realising our commitments to protecting information effectively.

To achieve this, we have created the MoJ ICT Security Policy Framework (see Figure 1). This framework sets the policy foundation of what is expected with supplementary standards, guidance and procedures provided to support that foundation. These arrangements cover security risks that are common across the Department or where a standardised approach is needed to align with other Departments (i.e. HMG Security Policy Framework). In addition, specific arrangements may be developed within various parts of the Ministry of Justice for the delivery of security and management of risks that are specific to each business area. HMCTS, for example, will require guidance and procedures for managing the various security risks associated with the business of the courts.

### Review and Approval Process

The MoJ ICT Security Policy Framework is a 'living' framework designed to adapt and change with the MoJ. Changes to the framework can come from updated ICT Security advice from HM Government to new technologies or working practices.

To manage this change and provide governance, an ICT Security Policy review board chaired by the IT Security Officer (and includes representation from the business through IA leads) has been established to review internal and external changes in the business environment and its impact on the policy framework within the following criterion:

- At least once a year;
- Following a serious security incident highlighting weaknesses in our ICT Security measures; and
- In the light of any future changes relating to:
  - Major changes in policy, HMG standards and guidance, or context of operations;
  - Modification, replacement or creation of new services or major applications; or
  - Recommendations following formal risk analysis reviews and system accreditations.

### Approval Process

ICT Security policy documents or artefacts which constitute the MoJ ICT Security Policy Framework are reviewed by the ICT Security Policy review board and recommended for approval by the ICT Security Officer.

Approval is provided by the MoJ Head of ICT Information Assurance. Upon approval, a release version is generated and published as part of the MoJ ICT Security Policy Framework.

## Commitment to Training and Awareness

The level of security in any organisation depends largely on the security awareness of management and of staff. As such, security is a collective responsibility and all MoJ staff (including contractors) need to play their part.

Strong security countermeasures can be weakened if they are not observed or used properly. Therefore it is an important requirement that there is an on-going Departmental security awareness and training programme. This ensures that all staff members are aware of the principles of protective security (the need to keep MoJ information assets secure) and alert to the threats to the organisation and national security The MoJ's Information Security awareness programme plays an essential part in maintaining security. It informs all MoJ staff of:

- Their duties with regard to security;
- Their responsibilities to protect the assets (information, equipment, people and buildings) they have access to and use;
- The importance of reporting any actual or suspected security incidents.

Guidance is provided to staff via the Security section of the MoJ Intranet, (<https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/security/>), induction events, awareness material (i.e. posters etc) and, awareness events. These processes are complimented by line managers ensuring that their staff members are aware of and abide by security procedures and policies and understand the risks associated with noncompliance. All new staff starting work within the Ministry of Justice will receive mandatory IA training. This should ensure that the new staff member is made aware of their security responsibilities whilst working at the Ministry of Justice.

## Approach to Business Continuity Management

Business continuity management (BCM) is a business-owned and business-driven holistic process that organisations use to identify, in advance, potential threats that may impact upon the strategic and tactical capability of business operations and to tolerate the loss of part or all of its operational capacity.

It provides a structure for building corporate resilience with the capability and capacity to respond in an effective manner that will help to preserve the interests of the organisation by managing continuity and business recovery in the event of a disruptive incident.

The key elements of ICT BCM include understanding:

- The overall context within which the ICT System operates;
- The business critical services and objectives that ICT Systems must deliver;
- The barriers or potentially disruptive elements that may be encountered in trying to deliver those services;
- How an ICT System can continue to achieve its objectives in the event of a disruption;
- The likely range of outcomes when an ICT System implements controls and risk mitigation strategies;
- The criteria or triggers for implementing incident response and business recovery procedures;

And:

- Ensuring that all staff understand their roles and responsibilities when a major disruptive event occurs;
- Building consensus and commitment into the implementation and exercising of business continuity management procedures.

## Approach to Monitoring, Investigation, Auditing and Breach Reporting

As part of our commitment to protect the information held and processed on our ICT systems, it is important that we can detect and respond to security incidents as quickly as possible and where possible instigate preventive measures to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems.

Staff using MoJ ICT systems need to be aware that these systems are proactively monitored and activity reviewed by the MoJ Defensive Security Operations Team (DSOT). In addition, the MoJ maintains an IT forensic capability to investigate security incidents. Breaches and examples of poor personal security will be taken seriously and where appropriate, disciplinary procedures (including in severe cases, prosecution or loss of security clearance) form part of the process.

Incident reporting and management are fundamental to good IA practice, through mandatory IA training; all users are informed of the MoJ ICT Security policy in operation and the escalation process for reporting security incidents.

All actual or suspected ICT security incidents must be reported immediately. In general this will be to your line manager. Where an incident involves the loss of any data (including personal data), it must also be reported to the MoJ Data Access and Compliance Unit (DACU), further information is available on the MoJ intranet at the following location: <https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/security/report-a-security-incident/>
