## The GSI community security policy

The security of the Government secure intranet (GSI) depends in part on the security standards, procedures and technical countermeasures employed by user departments.

The community security policy (CSP) sets out requirements, which user departments must meet as a condition of connection to the GSI in order to ensure the security of the GSI common intranet services.

### The role and function of the GSI

The GSI allows connections to take place between its members, usually Government departments to each other via a common backbone and provides access to the internet and other external networks. It provides facilities similar to those being used by many commercial organisations, for example:

- exchange of electronic mail between the internal networks of individual Government departments
- exchange of electronic mail between Government departments and businesses or individual citizens connected to the Internet and other electronic services
- access to the internet world wide web from browsers running on client machines in Government departments
- access to internal (Government only) web pages from browsers in Government departments, ie intranet facilities

The GSI is secure for handling information at OFFICIAL, including information marked as OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE and at the legacy protective markings up to and including RESTRICTED. Users of the GSI must possess [Baseline Personnel Security Standard (BPSS)](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/hr/recruitment/security-vetting/contractor-agency-staff/national-security-clearance-for-contractorsagency-staff/) clearance or an acceptable government equivalent.

It is the responsibility of system owners to ensure that their systems (ie their data) are protected by technical and procedural countermeasures appropriate to the sensitivity of material handled within those domains.

### GSI entry qualifications

Before any connection can be made for access to GSI services, the department must:

- agree to comply with entry criteria set out in the connecting department's compliance certificate, which the departmental security officer or system owner must sign confirming compliance with this CSP
- provide security documentation (usually the findings of a Risk Assessment) in support of the Compliance Certificate that demonstrates compliance with appropriate physical, procedural and technical security measures

Compliance by all members of the community with these qualifications enables all members to trust the intranet up to a level of restricted. In terms of re-accreditation, GSI members must confirm their continued compliance with the GSI CSP at six-monthly intervals.
