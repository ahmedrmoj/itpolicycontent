# Web browsing

Electronic communication and web browsing facilities are provided to help you to do your job effectively and efficiently. Your use of these facilities is governed by the rules set out by IT security branch.

Reasonable personal use is allowed, provided that:

* it is sanctioned by your line manager
* it does not interfere with the performance of your duties.

You and your manager are responsible for ensuring that your use of electronic communication and web-browsing facilities complies with the Department’s IT security awareness.

You must not:

* Use email or the public folders via the internal bulletin boards to conduct trivial debates or exchanges with an individual or group of individuals.
* Use the ZZ mail groups for anything other than appropriate business purposes. For personal matters, staff should use the bulletin board folders in Microsoft outlook.
* Circulate messages or material that contains obscene, profane, inflammatory, threatening, harassing (racially, sexually or otherwise), and disruptive, or otherwise offensive language.
* Make statements that defame, slander or lower the reputation of the Department, any person or organisation.
* Forward e-mail chain letters to your e-mail contacts (you must report these to IT security branch).
*   Download or view, possess, distribute, or hold in any form images, text or other materials of an offensive or indecent nature (such as pornography, racist or sexist material or violent images) or which encourage or promote activities, which would if conducted, be illegal.
*   Download or view, possess, distribute, or hold in any form or copy a copyright work (whether it be a document, photograph, a piece of music or video or something else) unless they are properly authorised to do so by the copyright owner.
*   Run downloaded software (whether on computer, disk or CD) on departmental equipment without prior authorisation from the appropriate IT business service owner.
*   Subscribe or post messages to any Internet service, such as bulletin boards, mailing lists, information services, newsgroups, chat rooms or any other service without a clear business need.

If you accidentally connect to a web site that contains unsuitable, illegal or offensive material, you must disconnect from the site immediately and inform IT security branch.

You should guard against excessive use of e-mail (and in particular the inclusion of unsuitable attachments, ie video clips, images, executable files and/or sending to large numbers of recipients), which can affect the efficiency of the network system as a whole. For further information ask your manager or your local IT officer.

The Department will monitor the use of electronic communications and web-browsing. Your manager can request reports detailing your activity if they suspect inappropriate use of email or web-browsing facilities.

# Internet filtering

This document sets out MoJ's Internet rules applied to the DISC infrastructure and provides information relating to websites that are either permitted or not permitted depending on the policy group you are assigned to.

## Why do we use internet filtering?

Web filtering solutions allow web access within MoJ to be controlled and monitored according to Acceptable Use Policy (IT Security Guide). Websites that are considered inappropriate in a work environment are blocked, as well as those known to host spyware, adware and other malicious code. This includes sites that are dedicated to potentially illegal activities, extreme political views, adult content and online gaming.

In addition, the use of any online services that could result in network capacity issues or poor performance of MoJ key applications may also be restricted, for example, streaming video. This helps to maintain MoJ productivity and ensures compliance to MoJ policies for web browsing.

These rules ensure that decisions made by you, your manager and HR are consistent. The technology reduces the need for you to be concerned whether your web browsing is putting the MoJ network at risk. A balance will be applied to the rules to support you in your 'work-life' balance objectives while maintaining the security and availability of the network and our IT systems.

*   Websites that you genuinely need to access to carry out your duties will not be blocked.
*   Procedures exist to enable you to access sites which are ordinarily blocked where there is a genuine business requirement for you to do so. This must be supported by a strong business justification and be subject to a risk management decision.
*   The technology stops you either intentionally or unintentionally accessing websites that are considered inappropriate and therefore help prevent you from breaching the Electronic Working and Web Browsing Policy.
*   The technology prevents you from inadvertently downloading malicious code while you are legitimately browsing the web.
*   Some of your personal use of the web may be curtailed, for the sake of security. Where access to a website is classified as inappropriate, or to websites that have been compromised by hackers and have malicious code and where total combined use of the Internet exceeds the MoJ’s available contracted bandwidth.
*   All activity on your use of the Internet will be logged and the policy group you are assigned to will determine whether your activity will be reported upon.

Electronic communication and web browsing facilities are provided to help you to do your job effectively and efficiently. Your use of these facilities is governed by the rules set out by MoJ IT.

## Standard internet profile exemptions

Some members of staff do have a genuine business need to access sites that as a general rule will not be permitted.  Even though there may still be a level of risk associated with this access, it is access that we are able to audit and manage and therefore they will be given permission.

In order for you to access the sites that are not permitted in order to do your job, you will need to submit an Internet profile amendment form to the Operational Security Team.

*   [Internet profile amendment form](/documents/2015/04/internet-profile-amendment-form.doc)

This order should include details of your business case and must clearly describe why you will be unable to perform your role effectively if you do not have access to these media. The request must be endorsed by your line manger. You will be informed within 5 days, if your request has been approved. If your request is approved you will need to complete a catalogue order form to request changes to your internet profile.

Details can be found in the IT Service Catalogue. Please refer to the [IT portal](/guidance-and-support/it-services/it-portal/). The IT Service Desk will check with Operational Security that a business case has been authorised before any changes are made to your profile.

## Responsibilities

It is your responsibility to ensure that you comply with the IT Security guide and HR’s Conduct IT Policy. You should remember that IT Security guidance is in place which deals with internet related issues and the onus is on you to make sure you have read it, understood it and follow it in your working life.

If you experience any problems accessing the Intranet/Internet please raise an incident with the IT Service Desk.

If you have any further questions, please contact the Operational Security Team.

# Whitelisting

Considerations to be taken before requesting a web address (URL) to be whitelisted when planning the implementation of a new service on DOM1 or OMNI.

Before you request any whitelisting the relevant testing should have been be carried out preferably following a system supplier’s recommendations, with any blocks generated by the Trustwave proxy server being notified to the Operational Security Team (OST) ![](https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/intranet-prod-storage-1dvcquh7kophi/uploads/2017/12/c44e91c8a5d308c4953ef918b987f543.gif)&nbsp; within MoJ Digital & Technology.

Project Managers should be aware that OST can only address certain blocks and that our infrastructure suppliers may need to be involved if any firewall changes are required.

Please be aware that requests for whitelisting are not processed on a pre-emptive basis. Internet filtering bypass exception requests are only considered where it can be demonstrated that a blocked web page has been triggered by a policy rule violation within MoJ web traffic monitoring and filtering systems.

At such point any block will be analysed and assessed to determine the risk of impact to MoJ's networks that unblocking the web URL may potentially cause.

If it can be demonstrated that the requested URL does encounter such a block we would ask you to provide the transaction ID and notify this to OST. We will then work with you to identify a solution and, if appropriate, add the URL to the relevant policy rule bypass list.

It can at times be difficult to identify the reason why a website does not work and in these cases OST will work with you during testing to unblock the site on a temporary basis.

The table below shows the areas of responsibility for the various network components through which web traffic passes and therefore can potentially be the source of a website not working.

| Resource | Responsible Area |
| --- | --- |
| URL Proxy Server | OST |
| IP Firewall | Atos SopraSteria |
| Email Allowed Sender address/domain | OST/Vodafone (GSi) |

All requests for access to blocked or unavailable web pages for HMPPS users should be directed to the HP Service Desk via a local or area IT Manager.
